eltakoMS parses and logs the RS485 serial datastream of the
Eltako Multisensor weather sensor (temperature, direct sunlight from 3
directions, dawning, obscurity, wind, rain). A datasheet can be found on
http://www.eltako.com/dwl/Multisensor%20MS_4801_internet_gb.pdf .

Incoming datagrams

are converted to a more human readable format and get timestamped
